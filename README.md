# Virus_Fighter
This was my Object-Oriented Programming project. 
The project implements the four main concepts of OOP :
(Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism ).
We've also used SQLite to save last played level for each player.
You could view and play the game at http://virusfighter.atwebpages.com/
